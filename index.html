  About Me
  </h1>
    <div style="text-align: justify">  
    <p style="font-family: Arial"> Hello, my name is Mpho Mafata. I am currently working as a post-doctoral fellow with the database team at the <a href="https://www0.sun.ac.za/crest/">Center for Research on Evaluation Science and Technology (CREST)</a>, South Africa. 
    Previously, I was a joint post-doctoral fellow at the <a href="https://sagwri.sun.ac.za/">South African Grape and Wine Research Institute (SAGWRI)</a>, as well as the Stellenbosch Universityâ€™s School for Data Science and Computational Thinking. I generally work in interdisciplinary environments with very different types of data (structured and unstructured). 
    I have practiced technical skills in separation sciences (chromatography) and detection (mass spectrometry, UV-vis and fluorescence spectroscopy), wet lab/preparatory chemistry (sample preparation of organic compounds and natural products), oenology (winemaking and sensory analysis), and multivariate data analysis (MDS, MCA, PCA, MFA). 
    My research is in the applications of Data Science in the fields: Analytical Chemistry, Biotechnology, Sensory evaluation, and Oenology.
